# TODO

* Documentation
* Unit Tests
* Fix iOS vs OSX build targets
* Double check operater precidence - forced to do some weird casting right now
* Demo projects
* Really understand public vs private vs internal (see BezierCurve)
* Unsure about some of the convenience init() methods. They're serve no purpose other than reducing typing and visual clutter.

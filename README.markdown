# SwiftGraphics

Bringing Swift goodness to Quartz.

See TODO.markdown for short term plans.

## Philosophy

Wrap Quartz (and other related Frameworks such as CoreImage) in a nice "Swifthonic" API.

Provide wrappers and operators to help make working with graphics primitives in swift as 
convenient as possible.

## Usage

SwiftGraphics builds iOS and OSX frameworks. Just add SwiftGraphics.xcodeproj to your project and set up your dependencies appropriately.

You can play with SwiftGraphics in Xcode 6 Playgrounds. Use Demos/SwiftGraphicsDemos.xcworkspace.

## Help Wanted

Your help wanted. I would definitely appreciate contributions from other members of the 
Swift/Cocoa community. Please fork this project and submit pull requests.

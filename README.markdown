# SwiftGraphics

Bringing Swift goodness to Quartz.

See TODO.markdown for short term plans.

## Philosophy

Wrap Quartz (and other related Frameworks such as CoreImage) in a nice "Swifthonic" API.

Provide wrappers and operators to help make working with graphics primitives in swift as 
convenient as possible.

## Help

Your help wanted. I would definitely appreciate contributions from other members of the 
Swift/Cocoa community. Please fork this project and submit pull requests.
